In general, we call the caching process for both saving the data and reading it when needed. With Caching, we can reduce our response times, provide a better user experience and benefit from reducing unnecessary costs. Redis is the NoSQL database that keeps data in memory. I talked about in-memory cache and distributed cache methods in the project. InMemoryCache, as it is known, is a type of cache saved in the server memory. IDistributedCache is the method by which we save data completely independent of server memory. You can find its two methods, its advantages and disadvantages in the project.
